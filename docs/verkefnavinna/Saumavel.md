Ólöf experimented with her fabacademy project with the embdoidery machine and learned about inkstitch. She prepared a Logo which was stitched 3 times with 3 different settings regarding outline, pattern fill and colour swatches. Here are directions on how to prepare a file for embroidering.

     To begin with you open the Inkscape program...
     ... **Object** and then **Fill and stroke**. There you turn **Fill** on and turn of **Stroke paint**. Then you save the file as an .svg file so that you can edit it later on if you want to.



Sarah and Alissa tried and failed mission, preparing inkspace file for seeing text in inkstitch. Troubleshoot on written Name in Inkspace when simulating the graphic and text, onlz the logo graphic was visible for stitching simulation/preview.

Ólöf helped us in finding out how to save the svg and pes files for checking the text ifit appears, but that unfortunately did not work. Yout Tube video gave us the hint about inkspace lettering, worked for us to place the text and see it simulated, but did not work to get the right colour and design as prepared beforehands on inkspace. Now, we figured it out, so it will be stitched with the text and the temporary logo for the Textíllab.

Pictures are following.
