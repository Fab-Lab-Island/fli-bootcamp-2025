### Youtub tutorial for Inkstitch

These are the tutorials I watch to get used to using inkstitch. They cover the basics, but there is a lot that can be done with this program.

### Inkstitch Basic Principles

Inkstitch .pes file also build from the bottom up. The shape on the lowest on the layer will stitch first and the top object will stitch last. You can alway check how it will stitch by going to extenstions> inkstitch> preview

Filled ojects are fill stitch by default. 

Dashed line are a single stitch.

All texts need to be converted from odject to stroke. Also, they sometimes need to be ungrouped. 
object > object to path

Satin line thickness should never be less than 1.5 mm, however 2.0 mm or more is the most ideal.
